SPARKLE DETAIL - SIMPLE STATIC SITE (NO CODING REQUIRED)
-------------------------------------------------------
Files included in this zip:
- index.html         -> Main website file (edit text directly)
- styles.css         -> Styling (do not need to edit)
- images/            -> Folder for your images (logo.png, hero.jpg...). placeholders included
- README.txt         -> This file (you're reading it)

How to use (step-by-step, very simple):
1) Download and unzip this file on your computer.
2) Open the folder. You'll see index.html and styles.css and an 'images' folder.
3) Replace images/logo.png and images/hero.jpg with your own images (keep the same filenames).
   - To replace: right-click your image file -> Rename to logo.png then drag into images folder and choose 'Replace'.
4) Edit text (optional): Right-click index.html -> Open With -> Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). 
   - Find text like 'Sparkle Detail' or phone number and change it to your details. Save the file.
5) Preview locally: Double-click index.html to open it in your web browser. You will see your site.
6) To publish on the web using GoDaddy (since your domain is there), follow the 'Upload to GoDaddy' instructions below.

Upload to GoDaddy (simple file manager method):
A) Sign in at godaddy.com
B) Click your name (top-right) -> My Products
C) Under 'Web Hosting' or 'Website Builder' find your hosting plan and click Manage.
D) In Hosting Dashboard click 'cPanel Admin' (if using cPanel-based hosting).
E) In cPanel look for 'File Manager' and click it.
F) In File Manager, open 'public_html' folder (this is where website files go).
G) Click Upload -> Select File(s) -> Choose the files from THIS ZIP (index.html, styles.css, images folder contents).
   - If you upload a folder, some File Managers require uploading files individually. Upload index.html and styles.css and upload image files into a new 'images' folder.
H) After upload, visit https://sparkle-detail.com to see your site (it may take a few minutes).

Alternative: Deploy to Vercel (free) and then update GoDaddy DNS to point to Vercel - recommended if you want automatic updates.
If you want the step-by-step for Vercel deployment, say 'VERCEL' and I will provide exact clicks.

CONTACT FORM:
The included contact form posts to a Formspree URL. To use Formspree:
1) Go to https://formspree.io and sign up for free.
2) Create a new form and copy the endpoint (looks like https://formspree.io/f/xxxxx).
3) Open index.html in a text editor and replace the 'action' URL in the <form> tag with your Formspree endpoint.
4) Save and re-upload the edited index.html to your hosting provider.

NEED HELP?:
If you want, paste your business details (name, tagline, phone, email, logo URL or attach the logo image) and I will update index.html for you and re-generate the zip so you can download the ready-made files and upload them to GoDaddy. I'm happy to provide exact click-by-click instructions for GoDaddy's interface once you're ready.
